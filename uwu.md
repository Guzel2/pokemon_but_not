# UwU card game territorial thingy

## Konzept:
- 2x4 Feld mit 4 schildern und 4 offenen slots pro person
- 40 Karten Decks, 3 mal jede karte max

### what to do during a turn/how many cards per turn
- beliebig viele viecher
- beliebig viele items
- ein supporter pro zug
- ein Mana pro zug
- -> Mana angriffe von viechern und starke abilites
- -> Ende des zuges wenn man angreift (man kann angreifen mit reihe für Mana)

### Coole Sachen:
- 2 Ablagestapel (discard & exile)
- deck stacking (vgl iono)
- evtl mehr shield hp 
- Area cards die Effekte auf dem Feld haben?

### Theming Ideas?
- summoning different kind of creatures/demons, sort of an arcane vibe to it? (very creative i know (summoning fantasy creatures??? in my collectable trading card game???? it's more likely than you think!!!)
- schon wieder sci-fi???? (bitte nicht)
- brauchen wir überhaupt nen theme momentan?

### card design guidelines
