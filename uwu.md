# UwU card game territorial thingy

## Konzept:
- 2x4 Feld mit 4 schildern und 4 offenen slots pro person
- 40 Karten Decks, 3 mal jede karte max

### what to do during a turn/how many cards per turn
- beliebig viele viecher
- beliebig viele items
- ein supporter pro zug
- ein Mana pro zug
- -> Mana angriffe von viechern und starke abilites
- -> Ende des zuges wenn man angreift (man kann angreifen mit reihe für Mana)

### Coole Sachen:
- 2 Ablagestapel (discard & exile)
- deck stacking (vgl iono)
- evtl mehr shield hp 
- Area cards die Effekte auf dem Feld haben?

### Theming Ideas?
- summoning different kind of creatures/demons, sort of an arcane vibe to it? (very creative i know (summoning fantasy creatures??? in my collectable trading card game???? it's more likely than you think!!!)
- schon wieder sci-fi???? (bitte nicht)
- brauchen wir überhaupt nen theme momentan?

## cards

### card design guidelines
- creatures: draw
- items: extra
- supporter: search

### volcanion abklatsch

creatures
- TEMPORARY NAME 5 HP  
  - Attack (1 Mana | 1 Dmg) Look at the top 4 of your deck, put 1 Mana into your hand, put the others at the bottom in any order  
  - Attack (2 Mana | 1 Dmg) Put 1 Mana from your discard into play.  

- TEMPORARY NAME 7 HP  
  - Active (1 Mana) Discard a Mana from hand: your attacks that deal 3 or less base damage do 1 more damage this turn  
  - Attack (3 Mana | 2+ Dmg) Return up to 2 of your Mana from play to hand, do 1 more damage per Mana  

items
- look at the top 5 (?) cards, if you found a Mana card put it into play (?) (ether)
- search your deck for 1 Mana card, show it, put it into your hand

supporter 
- both players draw/discard cards until they each have 4 (?) cards in hand
- sowas wie Kiawe? (search deck for 2 Mana then put into play? maybe temporary cause kinda op? and too fast/too much momentum)

### new card ideas that aren't volc specific

creatures
- draw mon 4 HP
  - Passive: "wenn zwei viecher nebeneinander liegen, kanns viele karten ziehen :)"


items
- 

supporter
- switch the position of two of your opponent's (adjacent?) creatures


### old cards (a little old but still good, mostly reuse the items and supporters)

creatures
- 1/1 itp: look at top 2, choose 1, exile other
- 0/1 opt: destroy an adjacent creature: +1/+1
- 1/2 if you have 5 or more exiled cards: +1/+1, also if you have 10 or more: +2/+2
- 2/1 itp and opt: adjacent creatures get +1/0 until end of turn
- 0/3 opt put 1 damage on this without killing it: draw until you have 3 in hand
- 1/4 between turns: heal 1 dmg from this

items
- You can only play this card if you have 4 or less cards exiled: exile a card from your discard, search your deck for a creature
- shuffle 2 creatures from your discard into your deck
- Put 6 exiled cards into your discard. If you do, switch 2 of your enemies adjacent creatures
- exile a card from hand, put 1 damage on an enemy creature

supporter
- both players shuffle their hands into the deck and then draw a card for each shield the enemy has. You may exile up to 2 cards from your discard, draw that many cards
- you may shuffle 1 of your creatures into your deck. draw 1 cards for each of your open spaces
- search your deck for 1 creature and 1 item, put them into your hand
- put 2 items from your discard into your hand
